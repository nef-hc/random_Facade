# random_Facade
Python generated HTML

My brother, who is an architect, was assigned to design a mosaic facade of 150 x 52 units; he asked me if it was possible to write a piece of code that would randomly assign (on a range of 1-6) colors to this units and display them.

The python section of the project deals with the randomization and creation of the html code needed to render the page; I would've liked to have a more pythonic way to write it, or even generate the whole html on strings, since I had to re-write and tweek alot of it on Atom.

The html section of the project is pretty straight forward and basic, since my brother knows no coding and needed the render to be as easy to implement as possible.

the jQuery animate was an after tought of something I'd have implemented at work earlier in the week.


Really looking forward to your comments and annotations! speaciially on the python code!!
